# PicsName

This is challenge 5 of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/6/3/challenge)). The challenge is an app that asks users to import a picture from their photo library, then attach a name to whatever they imported.

As with previous challenge projects, there will be no extra challenges at the end.
